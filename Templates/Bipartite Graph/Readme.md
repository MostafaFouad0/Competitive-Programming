# Bipartite Graph 
- A Bipartite Graph is a graph whose vertices can be divided into two independent sets such that no node is connected to a node in the same set

- **we can check if a graph is Bipartite or not by coloring the nodes such that the color of the neighbours of any node are different from it**

- **if we find a neighbour of the same color so the graph is not Bipartite see image downbelow**
